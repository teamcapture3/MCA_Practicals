A file is a collection of data stored in a disk with a specific name and a directory path.
When a file is opened for reading or writing, it becomes a stream.
The stream is basically the sequence of bytes passing through the communication path. There are two main streams: 
the input stream and the output stream
The input stream is used for reading data from file (read operation) and the output stream is used for writing into the file (write operation).
The System.IO namespace has various classes that are used for performing numerous operations with files, such as creating and deleting files, reading from or writing to a file, closing a file etc.
The FileStream class in the System.IO namespace helps in reading from, writing to and closing files. This class derives from the abstract class Stream.
You need to create a FileStream object to create a new file or open an existing file.
The StreamReader and StreamWriter classes are used for reading from and writing data to text files.
These classes inherit from the abstract base class Stream, which supports reading and writing bytes into a file stream.
The StreamReader class also inherits from the abstract base class TextReader that represents a reader for reading series of characters.
The StreamWriter class inherits from the abstract class TextWriter that represents a writer, which can write a series of character.
